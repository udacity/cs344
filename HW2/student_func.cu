// Homework 2
// Image Blurring
//
// In this homework we are blurring an image. To do this, imagine that we have
// a square array of weight values. For each pixel in the image, imagine that we
// overlay this square array of weights on top of the image such that the center
// of the weight array is aligned with the current pixel. To compute a blurred
// pixel value, we multiply each pair of numbers that line up. In other words, we
// multiply each weight with the pixel underneath it. Finally, we add up all of the
// multiplied numbers and assign that value to our output for the current pixel.
// We repeat this process for all the pixels in the image.

// To help get you started, we have included some useful notes here.

//****************************************************************************

// For a color image that has multiple channels, we suggest separating
// the different color channels so that each color is stored contiguously
// instead of being interleaved. This will simplify your code.

// That is instead of RGBARGBARGBARGBA... we suggest transforming to three
// arrays (as in the previous homework we ignore the alpha channel again):
//  1) RRRRRRRR...
//  2) GGGGGGGG...
//  3) BBBBBBBB...
//
// The original layout is known an Array of Structures (AoS) whereas the
// format we are converting to is known as a Structure of Arrays (SoA).

// As a warm-up, we will ask you to write the kernel that performs this
// separation. You should then write the "meat" of the assignment,
// which is the kernel that performs the actual blur. We provide code that
// re-combines your blurred results for each color channel.

//****************************************************************************

// You must fill in the gaussian_blur kernel to perform the blurring of the
// inputChannel, using the array of weights, and put the result in the outputChannel.

// Here is an example of computing a blur, using a weighted average, for a single
// pixel in a small image.
//
// Array of weights:
//
//  0.0  0.2  0.0
//  0.2  0.2  0.2
//  0.0  0.2  0.0
//
// Image (note that we align the array of weights to the center of the box):
//
//    1  2  5  2  0  3
//       -------
//    3 |2  5  1| 6  0       0.0*2 + 0.2*5 + 0.0*1 +
//      |       |
//    4 |3  6  2| 1  4   ->  0.2*3 + 0.2*6 + 0.2*2 +   ->  3.2
//      |       |
//    0 |4  0  3| 4  2       0.0*4 + 0.2*0 + 0.0*3
//       -------
//    9  6  5  0  3  9
//
//         (1)                         (2)                 (3)
//
// A good starting place is to map each thread to a pixel as you have before.
// Then every thread can perform steps 2 and 3 in the diagram above
// completely independently of one another.

// Note that the array of weights is square, so its height is the same as its width.
// We refer to the array of weights as a filter, and we refer to its width with the
// variable filterWidth.

//****************************************************************************

// Your homework submission will be evaluated based on correctness and speed.
// We test each pixel against a reference solution. If any pixel differs by
// more than some small threshold value, the system will tell you that your
// solution is incorrect, and it will let you try again.

// Once you have gotten that working correctly, then you can think about using
// shared memory and having the threads cooperate to achieve better performance.

//****************************************************************************

// Also note that we've supplied a helpful debugging function called checkCudaErrors.
// You should wrap your allocation and copying statements like we've done in the
// code we're supplying you. Here is an example of the unsafe way to allocate
// memory on the GPU:
//
// cudaMalloc(&d_red, sizeof(unsigned char) * numRows * numCols);
//
// Here is an example of the safe way to do the same thing:
//
// checkCudaErrors(cudaMalloc(&d_red, sizeof(unsigned char) * numRows * numCols));
//
// Writing code the safe way requires slightly more typing, but is very helpful for
// catching mistakes. If you write code the unsafe way and you make a mistake, then
// any subsequent kernels won't compute anything, and it will be hard to figure out
// why. Writing code the safe way will inform you as soon as you make a mistake.

// Finally, remember to free the memory you allocate at the end of the function.
